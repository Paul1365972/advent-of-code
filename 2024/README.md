# Advent of Code 2024

First Advent of Code I am participating in.

## Day 1/2/3

Total: ~ 100 min

Caught up the first three doors, the solutions are implemented in Rust with the goal of just getting the answer as quickly as possible.

## Day 4

Part 1/2: 30 min

Finally wrote code for part 1 that is more easily adaptable for any part 2.

## Day 5

Part 1: 25 min, Part 2: 3 min

The solution is awful time complexity wise O(n^2 + m), but was really easy to quickly implement!

## Day 6

Part 1: 25 min, Part 2: 10 min

## Day 7

Part 1: 15 min, Part 2: 1 min

## Day 8

Part 1: 25 min, Part 2: 5 min

## Day 9

Part 1: 15 min, Part 2: 45 min

I thought I had a nice solution for Part 2, but debugging it was hell.
In the end I just used the obvious suboptimal, but at least working, algorithm.

## Day 10

Part 1: 15 min, Part 2: 1 min

Wow that part 2 was suprisingly simple, turn a single Set into a List and done.

## Day 11

Part 1: 5 min, Part 2: 5 min

## Day 12

Part 1: 10 min, Part 2: 40 min

## Day 13

Part 1: 30 min, Part 2: 5 min

Parsing took waaay to long, all that time and it's not even pretty or performant.

Part 2 was predictable, but exciting.
Had to check to make sure that solutions are unique, but who would have thought that the linear algebra classes would be useful someday?!
