# Advent of Code 2024

First Advent of Code I am participating in.

## Day 1/2/3

Total: ~ 100 min

Caught up the first three doors, the solutions are implemented in Rust with the goal of just getting the answer as quickly as possible.

## Day 4

Part 1/2: 30 min

Finally wrote code for part 1 that is more easily adaptable for any part 2.

## Day 5

Part 1: 25 min, Part 2: 3 min

The solution is awful time complexity wise O(n^2 + m), but was really easy to quickly implement!

## Day 6

Part 1: 25 min, Part 2: 10 min

## Day 7

Part 1: 15 min, Part 2: 1 min
